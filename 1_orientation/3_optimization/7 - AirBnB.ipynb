    "Divide into groups to work on an improved version of the AirBnB assignment model. There is no \"right\" solution to this problem, so your goal is to come up with the best model that you can. After working on this, you will have an opportunity to present it to other students and get their feedback.\n",
    "Here are some ideas to get you started:\n",
    "* You can modify the R script to generate different input data for your model (e.g., you could add different neighbourhoods, change the start date of the trip, adjust the rating requirements). If you do this, keep a list of your criteria and the reason for these decisions.\n",
    "* You can ask your classmates for additional data about their preferences. Remember that collecting data is difficult and time-consuming, so you can't just assume that everyone will answer a 10-page questionnaire with detailed questions about their preferences. You need to justify why it's worthwhile to put effort into collecting more data. If you decide to do this, add the corresponding columns in the preferences.csv file and type in some made-up data so that you can run your model (unfortunately we don't have time for everyone to fill out more surveys).\n",
    "* Think about how you would present your solution to your classmates. Maybe you could send them a dashboard that shows the details of their assignment and roommates. Perhaps you could visualize all the selected bookings on a map so that everyone can see where their friends will be located.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs\n",
    "* Provide a brief summary of how and why you have modified the assignment model. Describe any assumptions you have made and any additional data that you are using.\n",
    "* Provide a notebook with a full version of your code. Use comments to explain any new constraints or variables that you have added.\n",
    "* Provide a csv file with your best solution and an example of how you would share your solution with other students (plots, dashboards etc.)"
